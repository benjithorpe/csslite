### Why use it

CSSLite is lightweight, minimal and simple to get started with. It styles raw HTML elements (also offers a few additions _with some classes_) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.

- Around 250+ lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's simple to get started with.
- It's Opensource!
- Change anything in the stylesheet to suit your comfort.
- Rename classes, colors, etc... to whatever you like and want 
- No compiling or installing... just plain vanilla CSS
- Use with other frameworks or your custom CSS with no fuss.
