## Issues

Always comment on an issue you want to work on, so as not to cause merge conflicts or late pull requests.


## Making Edits

Make sure that you work in the branch you want to make changes to. _eg:_ 

> Assume you want to make changes to the HTML `forms`, create a local branch name `csslite/forms` or use the existing one on the repo.

Test all your changes in different ways (or browsers) and make sure they work.


## Commit Process

On git commit, we plan to follow these styles:

> - **\[feat] (forms): Summary/Heading**
> 
>  optional note here about what changed

1. [feat] describes what type of changes you made.
2. (forms): describes on what area the features were added.
3. Summary/Heading - short summary of what changed
4. Optional body goes into detail of what happened.


##### Summary of features and templates
> 1. **[feat]** - New feature to be added
> 2. **\[fix](optional issue_ID)**  - What fixes you did on what issue
> 3. **[edit]** - What file you edit (typo, comments)
> 4. **\[Addition](branch_name)** - What file, folder, or branch you added.


## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure that you include the issue_ID for which you are doing the pull request.

2. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers/maintainers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
